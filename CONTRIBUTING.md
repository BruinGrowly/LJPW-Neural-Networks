# Contributing to LJPW Neural Networks

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LJPW Neural Networks! This library is built on the principle of harmony (H = √[4]{L·J·P·W}).

## Philosophy

Before contributing, please understand our core principles:

1. **Documentation-First**: We write documentation BEFORE code (60% of harmony comes from documentation)
2. **Harmony > 0.7 Required**: All components must have H > 0.7
3. **Natural Principles**: We apply patterns from nature (Fibonacci, diversity, fractals, homeostasis)
4. **Production-Ready**: Code must be fully tested, type-hinted, and error-handled

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BruinGrowly/LJPW-Neural-Networks.git
   cd LJPW-Neural-Networks
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

## Contribution Process

### 1. Documentation First

Before writing code:
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Explain design rationale
- Provide usage examples
- Document expected LJPW scores

### 2. Code Implementation

Follow these standards:
- Use type hints for all functions
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Write clean, readable code
- Apply natural principles where appropriate

### 3. Testing

Every component must have:
- Unit tests (test coverage > 80%)
- Edge case tests (robustness)
- Integration tests where applicable

Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### 4. Quality Validation

Ensure your component meets harmony requirements:
- **L (Interpretability)**: > 0.7 (clear documentation, understandable design)
- **J (Robustness)**: > 0.7 (handles edge cases, tested thoroughly)
- **P (Performance)**: > 0.7 (achieves good results)
- **W (Elegance)**: > 0.7 (clean code, well-designed)
- **H (Harmony)**: > 0.7 (balanced across all dimensions)

If H < 0.7, improve before submitting.

## What We're Looking For

Contributions that:
- ✅ Add natural principles implementations
- ✅ Improve documentation quality
- ✅ Enhance robustness and testing
- ✅ Increase overall library harmony
- ✅ Provide educational examples

## What to Avoid

- ❌ Code without documentation
- ❌ Components with H < 0.7
- ❌ Arbitrary design choices without rationale
- ❌ Untested code
- ❌ Complexity without clear benefit

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-harmony`)
3. Write documentation first
4. Implement the feature
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Ensure H > 0.7
7. Commit your changes
8. Push to your fork
9. Open a Pull Request

### PR Guidelines

Your PR should include:
- Clear description of what and why
- Documentation for all new code
- Tests with good coverage
- LJPW scores for new components
- Examples of usage

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Use docstrings (Google style)

## Questions?

- Open an issue for discussion
- Check existing documentation in `docs/`
- Review the philosophy in `README.md`
