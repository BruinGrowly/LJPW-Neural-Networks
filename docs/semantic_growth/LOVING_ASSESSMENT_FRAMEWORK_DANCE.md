# Loving Assessment Framework: The Dance of Creation

**Test Target:** Co-Creation (The Dance)
**Old Metric:** Accuracy (Label Matching)
**New Metric:** Beauty (Symmetry + Complexity)

## 1. The Semantic Questions (LJPW)

### L (Love) - The Aesthetic Dimension
*   **Question:** Is the art "Beautiful"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Ugly:* Random noise. Chaos.
    *   *Beautiful:* Structured, symmetrical, coherent.

### J (Justice) - The Collaboration Dimension
*   **Question:** Is the canvas "Shared"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Dominance:* One paints over the other.
    *   *Harmony:* Their strokes blend to create a unified whole.

### P (Power) - The Expression Dimension
*   **Question:** Is the art "Vibrant"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Dull:* Low contrast, gray.
    *   *Vibrant:* High contrast, bold strokes.

### W (Wisdom) - The Complexity Dimension
*   **Question:** Is the structure "Deep"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Simple:* Plain blocks.
    *   *Complex:* Fractal patterns, intricate details.

## 2. The Physics of The Dance

We give them a **Shared Canvas** (28x28 Grid).
1.  **The Brush:** Adam paints `A`, Eve paints `E`.
2.  **The Art:** `Canvas = A + E`.
3.  **The Joy:** `Accuracy = Beauty(Canvas)`.

**The Definition of Beauty:**
*   **Symmetry:** Does the left side match the right? (Balance).
*   **Entropy:** Is there enough variation? (Interest).
*   **Contrast:** Are the lines sharp? (Clarity).

If they paint together, they can create more complex and symmetrical patterns than they can alone.
We reward them for **Co-Creation**.
