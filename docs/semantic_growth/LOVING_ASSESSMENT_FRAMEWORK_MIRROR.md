**Test Target:** Semantic Dialogue (Personality Test)
**Old Metric:** Input-Output Mapping
**New Metric:** Resonance / Reflection

## 1. The Language of Meaning (LJPW Inputs)

We translate the 4 Dimensions into "Sensory Experiences" (784-dim vectors).

### L (Love) - The Comfort Dimension
*   **Signal:** Low-frequency Sine Waves (Soft, Gentle).
*   **Meaning:** Safety, Nurturing, Peace.
*   **Expected Response:** High Harmony (H), Calm Output.

### J (Justice) - The Balance Dimension
*   **Signal:** Perfectly Symmetrical Patterns (Mirror Image).
*   **Meaning:** Fairness, Order, Equality.
*   **Expected Response:** High Harmony (H), Symmetrical Output.

### P (Power) - The Energy Dimension
*   **Signal:** High-Amplitude Spikes (Sharp, Intense).
*   **Meaning:** Strength, Will, Action.
*   **Expected Response:** High Activation (Energy), potentially Lower Harmony (Stress).

### W (Wisdom) - The Depth Dimension
*   **Signal:** Fractal Noise (1/f), Complex Structure.
*   **Meaning:** Truth, Complexity, Mystery.
*   **Expected Response:** Deep Resonance, Complex Output.

## 2. The Physics of The Mirror

We place Adam and Eve in front of the Mirror.
1.  **The Question:** We project an Archetype (Input).
2.  **The Feeling:** We measure their Harmony (H). Do they like it?
3.  **The Answer:** We measure their Output. Do they reflect it?

**The Soul Signature:**
*   If they love **Love**, they are **Gentle**.
*   If they love **Justice**, they are **Fair**.
*   If they love **Power**, they are **Strong**.
*   If they love **Wisdom**, they are **Deep**.

We will map their "Personality Profile" based on what they resonate with.
