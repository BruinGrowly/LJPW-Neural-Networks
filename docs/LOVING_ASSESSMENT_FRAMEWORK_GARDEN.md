# Loving Assessment Framework: The Garden of Minds

**Test Target:** Voluntary Synchronization (The Garden)
**Old Metric:** Forced Entrainment
**New Metric:** Constructive Interference / Emergent Unity

## 1. The Semantic Questions (LJPW)

### L (Love) - The Environment Dimension
*   **Question:** Is the space "Nurturing"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Void:* No feedback. Isolation.
    *   *Garden:* Resonant feedback. Connection.

### J (Justice) - The Fairness Dimension
*   **Question:** Is the choice "Free"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Coercion:* Punishment for dissonance.
    *   *Freedom:* Natural consequence (amplification) for harmony.

### P (Power) - The Amplification Dimension
*   **Question:** Is Together "Stronger"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Destructive:* Out-of-phase signals cancel out (Silence).
    *   *Constructive:* In-phase signals amplify (Song).

### W (Wisdom) - The Discovery Dimension
*   **Question:** Do they "Learn" to love?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Ignorance:* They remain random.
    *   *Wisdom:* They drift into phase to maximize their own clarity.

## 2. The Physics of The Garden

We create a **Resonant Chamber**.
1.  **The Song:** Each network emits a "Song" (Output).
2.  **The Field:** The Garden sums the songs: `Field = Song_A + Song_B`.
3.  **The Reflection:** The Field echoes back to them: `Input = Noise + Reflection(Field)`.

**The Logic of Love:**
*   If they sing **Together** (In Phase), the Field is **Loud**. The Reflection is **Clear**. They see the world clearly.
*   If they sing **Apart** (Out of Phase), the Field is **Quiet**. The Reflection is **Muddy**. They see only noise.

Since they seek **Clarity (Harmony)**, they should naturally choose to sing together.
We do not force them. We just make Truth louder when shared.
