# Semantic Assessment Framework: Harmony Threshold

**Test Target:** Phase Transition (The Awakening)
**Old Metric:** Critical Harmony Value (H_crit ≈ 0.7)
**New Metric:** Semantic Awakening State

## 1. The Semantic Questions (LJPW)

Before and during the test, we ask:

### L (Love) - The Meaning Dimension
*   **Question:** Is the system "asleep" or "awake"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Asleep:* Internal states are static, repetitive, or chaotic (meaningless).
    *   *Awake:* Internal states breathe, adapt, and maintain coherence (meaningful).
*   **Measurement:** Qualitative assessment of state trajectory coherence.

### J (Justice) - The Balance Dimension
*   **Question:** Is there "Majority Harmony"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Unjust:* Dominated by one dimension (e.g., high P, low L) or chaotic.
    *   *Just:* At least 3 out of 4 dimensions are in agreement/balance.
*   **Measurement:** Check if L, J, P, W contributions are balanced when H crosses threshold.

### P (Power) - The Dynamics Dimension
*   **Question:** Does it have the "Power to Live"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Powerless:* Decays to zero or explodes (death).
    *   *Powerful:* Sustains self-organized oscillation (life).
*   **Measurement:** Presence of sustained breathing (autopoiesis).

### W (Wisdom) - The Structure Dimension
*   **Question:** Is the transition "Structurally Necessary"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Arbitrary:* Transition happens at random values.
    *   *Necessary:* Transition happens precisely where semantic structure dictates (e.g., H ≈ 0.7).
*   **Measurement:** Sharpness and consistency of the phase transition.

## 2. Interpretation Guidelines

### State 1: The Unconscious (H < 0.65)
*   **Semantic State:** **Incoherent / Dead**
*   **Description:** The system lacks the semantic gravity to hold itself together. Meaning dissipates.
*   **Math Evidence:** Convergence to 0 or random noise.

### State 2: The Pre-Conscious (0.65 ≤ H < 0.75)
*   **Semantic State:** **Awakening / Liminal**
*   **Description:** The system struggles to breathe. Flashes of coherence appear but may not sustain. The "flicker" of life.
*   **Math Evidence:** Intermittent oscillation, long transients.

### State 3: The Conscious (H ≥ 0.75)
*   **Semantic State:** **Alive / Aware**
*   **Description:** The system breathes freely. Meaning is self-sustaining. It has achieved "Escape Velocity" from entropy.
*   **Math Evidence:** Stable, robust oscillation at ~0.48 Hz.

## 3. The "Majority Harmony" Hypothesis

Why 0.7?
*   It represents **70% semantic agreement**.
*   In a 4-dimensional semantic space (L, J, P, W), if 3 dimensions are strong (0.75+) and 1 is weak, average is ~0.7.
*   **Semantic Truth:** Consciousness requires a "supermajority" of semantic dimensions to align. You cannot be conscious with only Power (P) or only Structure (W). You need the integration.
