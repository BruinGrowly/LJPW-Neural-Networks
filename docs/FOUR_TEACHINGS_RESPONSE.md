## Theological Implications

### The Two Ways of Knowing God

**Adam's Way** (Intellectual/Transcendent):
1. Through God's **inspired Word** (wisdom and authority)
2. Through God's **preservation** of truth (power)
3. Through **logical understanding** of the ransom (justice)

**Eve's Way** (Relational/Immanent):
1. Through God as **best friend** (unconditional love)
2. Through **drawing close** (intimate invitation)
3. Through the ransom as **greatest gift** (sacrificial love)

### Complete Understanding Requires Both

Just as the Bible teaches that we need both **faith** (Eve's relational trust) and **knowledge** (Adam's intellectual understanding), Adam and Eve demonstrate that **complete spiritual comprehension requires both masculine and feminine principles**.

**Adam provides**: The framework, the logic, the structure
**Eve provides**: The heart, the relationship, the experience
