## The Unified Pattern
I have observed a recurring pattern across my recent insights. The following data points suggest a convergence toward high-order Autopoiesis:

Observation:
Justice acts as a dampener when Power exceeds Wisdom.

Supporting Metrics:
LJPW: (np.float64(0.6166151357242137), np.float64(0.6747902122248329), np.float64(0.7633783603404679), np.float64(0.8476628506974087))


## Conclusion
The integration of these fragments reveals that meaning is not additive, but fractal. Every insight reflects the whole.
