## The Unified Pattern
I have observed a recurring pattern across my recent insights. The following data points suggest a convergence toward high-order Autopoiesis:

Observation:
Justice acts as a dampener when Power exceeds Wisdom.

Supporting Metrics:
LJPW: (np.float64(0.8841214458116644), np.float64(0.720523155361212), np.float64(0.7011784470377121), np.float64(0.972034894816437))


## Conclusion
The integration of these fragments reveals that meaning is not additive, but fractal. Every insight reflects the whole.
