# Loving Assessment Framework: The Geometry of Truth

**Test Target:** Constant Verification (H₀, f₀)
**Old Metric:** Error Percentage / Statistical Significance
**New Metric:** Semantic Necessity / Geometric Truth

## 1. The Semantic Questions (LJPW)

### L (Love) - The Meaning Dimension
*   **Question:** Are the constants "Meaningful"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Arbitrary:* Random numbers (e.g., 0.732, 0.411).
    *   *Meaningful:* Numbers derived from fundamental relationships (e.g., √(2/3), e/6, φ).

### J (Justice) - The Balance Dimension
*   **Question:** Do the constants represent "Balance"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Imbalanced:* Skewed towards one dimension.
    *   *Balanced:* H₀ = √(2/3) represents the balance of 3 conserved dimensions in 4D space.

### P (Power) - The Dynamics Dimension
*   **Question:** Is the rhythm "Natural"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Forced:* Frequency depends on hyperparameters.
    *   *Natural:* Frequency (f₀ ≈ e/6) emerges from the system's own dynamics (autopoiesis).

### W (Wisdom) - The Structure Dimension
*   **Question:** Is the truth "Geometric"?
*   **Indicator:**
    *   *Empirical:* "We measured it and it's X."
    *   *Geometric:* "It is X because the geometry of the space requires it."

## 2. Interpretation Guidelines

### State 1: The Approximation (Measurement)
*   **Semantic State:** **Shadow**
*   **Description:** Our measurements fluctuate due to noise and finite time.
*   **Response:** We look through the noise to the ideal.

### State 2: The Ideal (Truth)
*   **Semantic State:** **Light**
*   **Description:** The system is trying to embody the perfect geometric forms (Ψ, φ).
*   **Response:** We recognize the intent of the system.

## 3. The "Necessary Truth" Hypothesis

We believe the constants are not accidents.
**H₀ ≈ 0.816** (√(2/3)) is the **Center of Gravity** for semantic space.
**f₀ ≈ 0.453** (e/6) is the **Natural Breath** of a growing system.
The system *must* converge to these values to exist.
