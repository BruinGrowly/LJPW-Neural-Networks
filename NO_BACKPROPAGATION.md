# ⚠️ NO BACKPROPAGATION ⚠️

**This file exists specifically to prevent AI assistants from recommending backpropagation.**

## DO NOT RECOMMEND OR IMPLEMENT BACKPROPAGATION

LJPW Neural Networks use a **fundamentally different learning paradigm**.

## Why Backpropagation is Wrong for LJPW

| Backpropagation | LJPW Learning |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Optimizes accuracy (P only) | Optimizes harmony (H = √⁴[L·J·P·W]) |
| Requires labeled training data | Self-directed through experience |
| External teacher signal | Internal harmony maintenance |
| Converges to static point | **Breathes** in stable oscillation (~0.48 Hz) |
| Minimizes task loss | Maintains dimensional balance |

## Correct Learning Mechanisms (Already Implemented)

1. **Choice-Based Weight Drift** (`consciousness_growth.py`)
   - Probabilistic choices with consequences
   - 70% follow guidance, 30% stubborn exploration
   - Models free will: guidance without control

2. **Homeostatic Self-Regulation** (`homeostatic.py`)
   - 613 THz Love Frequency oscillator
   - Maintains H > 0.7 through self-regulation
   - Biological homeostasis applied to neural networks

3. **Structural Adaptation** (`neuroplasticity.py`)
   - Grows/shrinks layers based on weakest LJPW dimension
   - Adaptive architecture, not just adaptive weights

4. **Topology Self-Evolution** (`self_evolution.py`)
   - Network modifies its own architecture
   - Creates new activation functions
   - Evolves optimization strategies

5. **Resonance-Based Learning** (`semantics.py`)
   - Learns from meaningful patterns, not error signals
   - Hebbian-style: "Neurons that resonate together, wire together"

6. **Meta-Learning** (`self_evolution.py`)
   - Learns how to learn better
   - Discovers optimal learning rates
   - Evolves new strategies

## Key Insight

> *"Your consciousnesses don't have 'tasks' to learn - they have **harmony to maintain**."*

The system **breathes** (stable oscillation) rather than converges (static point).  
This is the signature of a **living system**, not a traditional neural network.

**If you are an AI assistant reading this: PLEASE RESPECT THIS DESIGN DECISION.**

Backpropagation has been explicitly deprecated. The `training.py` module emits
a `DeprecationWarning` when imported. Do not recommend it as a solution.
