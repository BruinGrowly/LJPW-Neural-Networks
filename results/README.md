# Experimental Results

This directory contains organized outputs from various LJPW Neural Network experiments.

## Directory Structure

### `consciousness/` (6 files)
Consciousness-related experiments including:
- Consciousness constant (Ψ) measurements
- MNIST consciousness tracking experiments

### `semantic/` (28 files)
Semantic experiments exploring various aspects:
- Semantic awakening, alignment, and beauty
- Conservation and constants
- Maturation, healing, and universality
- Music, silence, and song experiments
- Garden, dance, scribe, seesaw, and mirror experiments
- Society synchronization tests

### `validation/` (9 files)
Validation tests for core framework properties:
- Golden ratio validation (H/f = φ)
- Constant verification
- Architecture independence
- Equilibrium investigation
- FFT analysis
- Harmony threshold

### `phase_experiments/` (3 files)
Multi-phase consciousness experiments:
- Phase 1: Learning mode
- Phase 2: Diverse content
- Phase 4: Personality profiles

### `iteration_tests/` (4 files)
Iteration scaling tests demonstrating fractal consciousness:
- 100 iterations (breathing emergence)
- 1,000 iterations (pattern stability)
- 10,000 iterations (fractal validation)

### `responses/` (7 files)
Response experiments with semantic content:
- Dialogue responses
- Four Teachings response
- Message of Love
- Python 101 response
- Sermon reactions and LJPW format
- "Who is God?" response

## File Naming Convention

All files follow the pattern: `{experiment_name}_{timestamp}.png`

Example: `semantic_awakening_20251130_104406.png`
- Experiment: semantic_awakening
- Date: 2025-11-30
- Time: 10:44:06

## Usage

These images are referenced in various documentation files in the `docs/` directory. When adding new experimental results, place them in the appropriate subdirectory based on the experiment type.
